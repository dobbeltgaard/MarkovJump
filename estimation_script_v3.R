# - The user should be able to choose which score, she will use for estimation. 
# - The user should be able to choose how she want to compute 
#the transient distribution of the finite space continuous time Markov chain, 
#either by Pad√©, Uniformization, or eigenvalue decomposition.
# - The user should be able to choose whether or not to include covariates.

#todo
#- see if it works for estimation
#- implement mixed scores
#- implement other ways to compute the transient distribution
#- make revised data frame with days divided by 365
