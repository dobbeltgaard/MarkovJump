# - The user should be able to choose which score, she will use for estimation. 
# - The user should be able to choose how she want to compute 
#the transient distribution of the finite space continuous time Markov chain, 
#either by Pad√©, Uniformization, or eigenvalue decomposition.
# - The user should be able to choose whether or not to include covariates.

#eigenvalue_decomp

#todo
#- see if it works for estimation
#- make revised data frame with days divided by 365. change name of s.?
#- eigenvalue decomp of relaxed g_erlang. 
#- forecast and eval functions
#- speed investigation of transient distribution methods

#compare rps and brier scores with previous implementation. Are they made correctly?






#comments: 
# free_upper_tri parameterization does not seem to work
# uniformization is not possible to perform with eigencpp yet. Some implementation work is needed. 
# gerlang_relax seems to work fine
# eigenvalue decomp seems to work fine for both gerlang and gerlang_relax, also with BFGS.
