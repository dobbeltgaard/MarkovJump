# - The user should be able to choose which score, she will use for estimation. 
# - The user should be able to choose how she want to compute 
#the transient distribution of the finite space continuous time Markov chain, 
#either by Pad√©, Uniformization, or eigenvalue decomposition.
# - The user should be able to choose whether or not to include covariates.

#todo
#- investigate if t*MGT is more meaningfull time parameterization



#comments: 
# rps and brier estimation on gerlang relax is meaningful, it just takes more iterations to reach convergence
# sensitivity on intialization seems to be resolved
